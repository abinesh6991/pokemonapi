                        <p>This website provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects built from thousands
                            of
                            lines of data related to <a href="">Pokémon</a>. We
                            specifically cover the video game franchise. Using this website, you can consume information
                            on
                            Pokémon, their moves, abilities, types, egg groups and much, much more.</p>

                    <h3 class="about-faq-title mt-4 mb-3">What is an API?</h3>
                    <div class="about-faq-content">
                        <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a contract that allow developers to interact
                            with
                            an application through a set of interfaces. In this case, the application is a database of
                            thousands of Pokémon-related objects, and the interfaces are URL links.</p>
                        <p>A RESTful API is an API that conforms to a set of loose conventions based on HTTP verbs,
                            errors,
                            and hyperlinks.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="about-faq-title mt-4 mb-3">Aren't there 101 other Pokémon websites already?</h3>
                    <div class="about-faq-content">
                        <p>Yes and that's exactly the problem!</p>
                        <p>101 instances of the same website means 101 instances of the <strong>same data</strong>.</p>
                        <p>We aim to provide a <strong>single source of data</strong> that any number of other websites
                            can
                            consume and use.</p>
                        <p>Often, and especially when new Pokémon games or updates are released, those 101+ websites
                            take
                            <strong>weeks</strong> to update as people have to enter the same information in all those
                            different places.
                        </p>
                        <p>This solves that problem. If all those sites consumed their data from here, they would have
                            the
                            exact same information that is updated at exactly the same time, with no errors between each
                            website. The overall benefit is a better collaboration and consistency across all the
                            different
                            Pokémon websites and applications. It's good for all!</p>

                    <h3 class="about-faq-title mt-4 mb-3">So who built this?</h3>
                    <div class="about-faq-content">
                        <p>PokéAPI V1 was created by <a href="">Paul Hallett</a> as a weekend
                            project but it quickly became more than a weekend's worth of work. In <a href=""
                                target="none">December of 2014</a> Paul deprecated V1 in favor of working on V2.</p>
                        <p>This is where <a href="">Zane Adickes</a> jumped in. Zane thought the
                            original project was a fantastic idea and wanted to help it grow. With direction from Paul,
                            Zane
                            created the V2 API using an exact mirror of <a href="">Veekun's</a> data
                            related to the main series of games.</p>
                        <p>During summer 2018, Paul decided to hand over the project to the community. This is where Tim
                            Malone, Mark Tse, Sargun Vohra, Charles Marttinen, Alessandro Pezzé, Alberto Oliveira da
                            Silva,
                            and Lucio Merotta came together and started planning how to change the infrastructure in
                            order
                            to improve performance and cut down on hosting costs. An important step was to convert the
                            API
                            to serve static JSON files, which was made possible by Sargun and his excellent <a
                                href="">PokeAPI/ditto</a> tool. The frontend website was
                            also re-built by Charles at the same time. The whole process was completed in October 2018.
                        </p>
                        <p>After this massive redesign, PokéAPI gained many new consumers due to its new blazing fast
                            performance. To give a quick reference, the loading of the infamous <a href="">Magikarp
                                pokemon
                                resouce</a> passed from
                            seconds to ~80ms. An important milestone for the PokéAPI project happened shortly after in
                            summer 2020, when its GitHub repository reached <strong>2000 stargazers</strong> and in a
                            single
                            month fulfilled <strong>100 million</strong> API calls.</p>
                        <p>In August 2020 the PokéAPI community decided <a href="">to temporarily fork</a> <a
                                href="">veekun/pokedex</a>, which was the primary and only
                            source of data. This operation was planned in order to add new generation-8 data, which
                            Veekun
                            lacked. The following people contributed to fetching and formatting generation-8 data: <a
                                href="">Alessandro Pezzé</a>, <a href="">Hoang Quoc Trung</a>, <a href="">Chandler
                                Mahkorn</a>, <a href="">André Sousa</a>, <a href="">Alexander Whan</a>, <a
                                href="">Austin
                                Jones</a>, <a href="">tomi-912</a> and <a href="">Eric Donders</a>.</p>
                        <p>The current owners of the PokéAPI project are <a href="">Paul Hallet</a>,
                            <a href="">Tim Malone</a> and <a href="">Alessandro Pezzé</a>. Alongside them other core
                            maintainers include <a href="">Charles Marttinen</a> and <a href="">Sargun Vohra</a>.

                    <div class="about-faq-content">
                        <p>We gathered the information on this site from various resources:</p>

                            <li>Generation 8 data is currently being added to the API by the PokeAPI community. The data

                    <h3 class="about-faq-title mt-4 mb-3">What's the technology stack?</h3>
                    <div class="about-faq-content">
                        <p>Up until November 2018, the API and website were built together in a single <a href=""
                                target="none">Python</a> project using the <a href="" target="none">Django framework</a>
                            and
                            paired with a <a href="" target="none">PostgreSQL</a> database to store the data.
                            <a href="" target="none">Django REST Framework</a> was used
                            to expose the data through a RESTful API. The entire stack was deployed at <a
                                href="">DigitalOcean</a>, initially paid by Paul and then
                            sponsored directly by DigitalOcean itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>In October 2018, the API was converted to serve static JSON files in a fully backwards
                            compatible
                            manner. This allowed PokéAPI to move its hosting to a cheap static hosting solution (<a
                                href="">Firebase</a> Hosting + <a href="">Cloudflare</a> Caching), which increased
                            performance and
                            stability by a huge margin.</p>
                        <p>The move to static hosting was solved by introducing a build step before deployment performed
                            by
                            <a href="">CircleCI</a>, our build system. This build step starts a local
                            Django copy of <a href="">PokeAPI/pokeapi</a> and saves each
                            possible endpoint as a JSON file using <a href="">PokeAPI/ditto</a>. All these JSON files
                            are
                            then
                            uploaded to Firebase and served to the public through a <a href="">Firebase function</a>
                            actioned by CircleCI.
                        </p>
                        <p>This website now uses <a href="">React Static</a> and
                            the code lives in it's own GitHub project at <a href="">PokeAPI/pokeapi.co</a>. Again,
                            CircleCI
                            takes
                            care of deploying it on Firebase as static files.</p>
